After the 1986 Miami Shootout, the FBI analyzed the gunfight. They concluded that agents were unnecessarily injured and killed because the ammunition they used lacked “stopping power”. They determined criteria for better ammunition. This project applies those criteria and models them using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).
